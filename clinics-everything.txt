We will not be returning to this office ever again! From the very beginning the front desk staff were rude and snooty. The woman who checked us in was very condescending when we had questions about what our insurance would cover. Then she became extremely sarcastic and belligerent when we weren’t aware and didn’t want to “put $200 down” on our account to be seen. This was after we had already paid her an almost $150 copay. Then she tells us to have a seat and slams the glass window shut in our faces and proceeds to talk about us with the other women in the office as if we couldn’t hear them through the glass. After a few minutes of this, the window flies open again and she slams our receipt on the counter and says “here” without looking up to see if we were still even sitting in the waiting room. We then wait another 20 minutes, with no one else in the office, to finally be taken back to a consultation room. When the doctor finally came in he was polite, shockingly enough after what we just went through, but he only wanted to give us the option of IUI or IVF with only having 1 semen analysis from my husband and both of us in perfect health and in our early 20’s. He made my husband feel so small because he didn’t give us the option of medications or shots, etc. to boost his count and let us try to conceive naturally with this being our first child. It seemed like his only concern was to collect the money from the IUI or IVF. After the consultation, he takes us up to the front desk to meet another snotty woman who glares at us like we were garbage only to look up and smile when the doctor looks up at her. Meanwhile, me and my husband are still very confused at what we are making another appointment for. After this woman hastily makes our appointment without explaining what it would be for, we start to leave the office. As we are walking out, both the receptionists we had the luck of encountering stare us down all the way to the door. Needless to say we canceled our appointment and we have found a more compassionate and welcoming office to start our journey.", "time" 1523055572} {"author_name" "Candi Parker", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113045351662650276956/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Uyx6PScMVlE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/3kInV-qEw44/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "a year ago", "text" "Very friendly, caring, and comforting staff.

It was a whole different story with Dominion from the first phone call. Everyone knew my name and I never had to repeat my whole story over and over. Their waiting room was relaxing with music, coffee and tea providing a comforting feeling during a very stressful time for me.  The front desk always acknowledged me with a friendly smile, and their office is right off the metro.  They took the time to explain my insurance coverage and answered my endless questions.  I was upset when I found out insurance wouldn't cover PGS, but given that was the key to my success it was worth the cost.\n\nExcellent patient care is their top priority. Lab work and scans can be scheduled very early in the morning which worked out perfect for me since I had to be at work by 8 am and did not want to explain any absences to my employer. All the nurses knew me especially Sam since she's the early bird.  They all knew my progress and called me in the afternoon with Dr. DiMattina's instructions.  He did most of my procedures and the other RE's I dealt with on the weekend knew my case and answered my questions during the monitoring.\n\nMost importantly I got pregnant with the first IVF Cycle. There are no words to express my gratitude to Dominion.   They were truly amazing; experts in their field, took their time explaining every single detail. I never felt rushed or like a number as I did at other clinics. It was easy to reach them via phone calls and emails.

Atlantic Reproductive Medicine Specialists (ARMS) is a perfectly adequate fertility clinic.   Through their care I have two beautiful girls and we can’t thank them enough. Indeed, they are quite personable including the hugs and prayers (as referenced in other reviews), which can be charming. \n\nIt is a small clinic and in many ways, this can make things more personable, however, I agree with Ann McCoy’s review and encourage you to review it as well.  Should your case be remotely complicated it may be best to find a larger clinic with greater resources.  In our quest for a third child I know that ARMS threw everything in their repertoire towards my case, but their medical notes left my new clinic baffled and the issues I had were not duplicated at the new clinic.\n\nMy new clinic is quite large (and out of state) but large doesn’t always correlate to impersonal.  ARMS follows HIPAA almost to a fault, meaning all correspondence and data is sent through their portal.  I rarely spoke to the nurses and ALL emails go through the portal, which is cumbersome and frustrating when you have a lot of questions (which you will).

I would expressly advise against using their services for anything.  I would also say that one of the things that appealed to me initially was that they offered reduced rates for Veterans.  I would like to advise my fellow Veterans to steer clear of this place, the same way you would of predatory used car dealerships.\n\n I use the VA for my medical care but because my wife has been stressing about us not getting pregnant and the VA has been taking forever to process my request to get a semen analysis, I elected to just go and pay to have it done myself without the referral from the VA.   This was done in order to save time and alleviate stress on my wife. \nI setup my appointment and during the course of the conversation the guy asked me who was referring me.  I EXPRESSLY told him that I did not have a referral.  That I was paying out of my own pocket and did not want to get insurance involved.  He told me that was fine.  I arrived at the requested 30 minutes before my appointment in order to complete initial paperwork.   Again, the guy at the front desk asked me for my referral form and I AGAIN explained the situation and that I did not have one.  He made no mention at any point that this would be a problem.   When my turn comes I provide the semen sample hand it in the lab window.  The lady working the counter informs me that since I haven't provided a referral, that they won't be able to tell me my results.  Excuse me?  First of all, why in the world would I undergo this process if there was no way I could get the results?  Why is it no one thought to tell me this until after?  She goes on to explain that 'legally' they can't release my results to me unless I have a referral. \nIt took me a little while to process this as I walked back out to reception to check out and pay.  I vented a little bit about the situation to the receptionist and his only response was to stare at me blankly.  He made no attempt to apologize for the confusion or help resolve the situation.  On the ride home I called my wife who pretty much broke down into tears (great job on helping alleviate that stress CC).  Upon arriving at home I learned that she had consulted with a friend who works as a receptionist in a doctor's office who told her that, by law, they CAN'T withhold test results from me, even if I haven't paid (which, by the way, I had).  \n\nI call them back up and work my way through their phone tree to finally get a hold of the same guy in reception.  He again makes no attempt at apology initially and it is only AFTER I ask to speak with someone higher up that he offers one.  Finally I'm put through to the manager.  After explaining the situation she again reiterates that they are legally required to withhold my results.  At this point I have the federal health and human services website pulled up and I start citing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, which expressly states that they are required to provide my test results.  Her response to THAT was that they were not a certified lab, and thus weren't obligated to do so.  \nWhat?  You aren't a certified lab?  Thats very interesting to learn, I wonder how many of your clients are under the impression you are.  And secondly, because you AREN\"T certified the law REQUIRES you to withhold my results?  Why?  Because they aren't accurate? She failed to provide any sort of reference to an actual law stating this.   In addition her attitude and general tone were less than conciliatory. \n\nI just got off the phone with the VA which has promised to look into the matter, was extremely understanding and also confirmed that they knew of no law that required the withholding of lab results.

Don't waste your money. I joined Coastal fertility after I had been trying to conceive for over a year without any success. (I already have a six year old, who was very easy to achieve, and the OBGYN said they couldn't see any reason why it may have been difficult to land another, so we landed here.\n\n1. Before they ran a single test, the doctor told me that they define infertility as \"Anyone who hasn't conceived within 12 months, with or without any form of BC\" - That should have been my red flag. I wonder how many other women they have said that to and immediately made them feel like they were struggling, even if there wasn't a real \"infertility\" issue. Maybe that's how they wrap you into the program.\n\n2. I conceived on my own after 13 months of trying, no treatments or hormones were necessary. So I would recommend...go home and try just a little longer before giving in and creating this monster of a bill.\n\n3. They build these financial plans, and they are extremely complex to comprehend. By the time I asked them to explain the financial portion to me and my mother (who works for the insurance co.) - we were understood that my insurance co. covered NOTHING before a VERY large deductible was covered. So we knew that everything would be out of pocket. After each visit I promptly paid my expenses in full, under the impression I covered everything to my obligation. Here we are over one year later, and I get a $184.xx bill in the mail. When I called the office and explained to her I was told my expenses would NOT be covered from the get go, that every time I paid I thought I had paid everything, and that I thought it was funny that they started to bill me bogus bills. She stated, \"This is what the insurance didn't cover\". But again,....I ALWAYS knew the insurance co. wouldn't cover and so did they, so why did they keep trying to bill it to the insurance co. and then hit me with an almost $200 bill a year later?\n\nThen I get a letter in the mail stating that they did an audit on my account, and according to our contracted terms, I was responsible for the bill. WHATEVER, I have bigger fish to fry. So I decide to start making payments towards this bill. I sent in a check through the mail, the same day I sent out several checks to other utility companies and bills due, and EVERYONE except Coastal received their check. How does the only bill out of 10 bill sent out that day not make it to them? Sounds a bit more like a them problem than a me or the postal service problem. I will pay the amount in full at my next paycheck, just to have my account closed.

A few hours before we went to see them, my wife and I decided to buy a home testing kit and low and behold it was positive!!!  Well, we figured since we had the appointment set that day we would go ahead and see them and run their test to confirm the results...AND THEY ALSO CONFIRMED IT WAS POSITIVE!!!!😅😅 They gave us a prescription, followed up with phone calls to us to check on how we were doing and scheduled follow up appointments with us in a very timely manner.  They were very friendly to us.  They gave us great instructions on future care and were very efficient in providing the medical records over to our selected OBGYN.  We felt very welcomed there and they were excellent and efficient in doing follow ups with us.

Although that decision is not always easy, it was one of the best decisions we have ever made thanks to Advanced Fertility Care. We met with Dr Zoneraich our first consultation appointment, and right from the start he was very thorough, understanding, and made both of us feel at ease. He explained why IVF was our best choice versus IUI because he took the time to listen to our previous miscarriage stories and research my medical history. Right from that consultation I knew that he was the doctor for us. I loved how he supported us and made us feel like he would do his all to help us conceive. We have now been through almost the whole IVF process and we are awaiting our implantation day. During the last 3 months we have been patients of the office I have met someone wonderful people. Some of the many wonderful employees that we drove crazy during this process, cause God knows between the hormone injections and our emotions flying high that is easy to do in this kind of situation. We love everyone at this office but we would love to recognize Stephanie, Tara, Sandy, Gaby, Bri, Ellen, and David, and so many more that I’m forgetting at the moment. The Advanced Fertility team is absolutely wonderful, and they never stop providing us with friendly patient care even if you call them 6 times in a day :) \nEach step and each process was handled very smoothly, and they have the process down to a tee. I love how organized they are, and that helped me give up control and allow them to do this for us. This was a major stepping stone for me and I thank the staff for that. We are so so excited for this final step of implantation, and you can genuinely hear in their voices they are just as excited as we are. We will never forget any one of the employees or doctors! We have had an incredible experience with AFC, and we know now that if we decide to have a second child we will for sure be back at this office again. We thank you all and we are forever grateful of your services and hopefully giving us our rainbow baby. We know this last step is in God’s hands now and you have all done your very best...\n\nForever Grateful, Brandon and Gabby", "time" 1522955307} {"author_name" "TJ Smith", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105761104829236925254/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sL_fh5IMBC0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/93gUS8NiXa0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 2, "relative_time_description" "5 years ago", "text" "DONORS/COUPLES BEWARE!!!

"text" "This was a hard review for me to write. Dr. Millie Behera of Bloom Reproductive has ruined my body.\n\nAnd from my experience she is uncaring, unprofessional and in it for the money. She pretended I was infertile when I simply had untreated polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - that she never told me about.\n\nAND... she hacked up my abdominal wall, cavity and uterus like I was being butchered! ...which has caused permeant damage and ongoing complications.\n\n I went to Dr. Millie Behera to have a uterine fibroid tumor removed. \n\n It was a terrible procedure that left me with a large incision in my linea alba, a fibrous structure that runs down the midline of the abdomen... that should not be cut.\n\nAs a result, it did not heal. And my intestines and lower part of my stomach have pushed through and are protruding out (hanging outside of my stomach area) as a large mass the size of a baseball. It looks horrible, and the pain is terrible! I can't eat without problems. Food gets stuck in it and it is continuing to tear the surrounding tissue. \n\nThe hospital procedure was a nightmare. In Scottsdale Hospital, immediately after the surgery, I had complications including excessively bleeding. But Dr. Behera could not be found - for days!\n\nI was put in the ICU for an extended period of time because I was having post surgical complications and Dr. Behera was unable to be located or reached by phone for days,\n\nIn addition, Dr. Behera did not prescribe any orders for any type of pain medicine - nothing - not even Ibuprofen (the nurses were dismayed). When they tried to contact her and her assistant; they could not be reached for several days. And as a result, the nurses were unable to prescribe any pain relief. When she finally did show up, she was visibly upset and accused me of acting like a \"drug addict\"! Yet, I was given no form of pain relief whatsoever. I was so shocked! \n\nI left the hospital with a very bad infection in my stomach and slightly anemic from the blood loss. \n\nWhen I went to her office, she said the infection was nothing. She even told me to resume jogging on the mountain right after the surgery. Later, I found out that because of that and the fact that she cut the ligaments in my uterus - that my uterus dropped. It is painful. \n\nI also found out - from another OBGYN - that I have PCOS, as evidenced by radiographs taken by Behera, but she failed to mention that as she began to prep me for a long and tedious and expensive fertility treatment protocol. If she simply treated me for the PCOS first - but where would the ongoing profit be for her? Really disappointed. I feel violated and used.\n\nI have ongoing medical complications that are painful and interfere with eating, exercising, working and all kinds of daily living - not to mention pregnancy!!!! All because of Dr. Millie Behera. \n\nPlus, the resulting cosmetic problems, make it all so much worse. \n\nWhen I wear tight fitting dresses, tops or bathing suits, I have a large herniated lump - the size of a baseball sticking out of my stomach (that is getting worse). When people notice it, I am all to happy to tell them my story and tell them that Doctor Millie Behera of Bloom Reproductive in Scottsdale hacked me up, betrayed my trust and took me for a lot of money. \n\nTo further make things worse, she kept having me come in (several times) to perform an ultra sound treatment on me where they would insert a long metal probe with a sharp end into my vagina, then tap on it with a hammer and pierce my cervix - then go into my uterus. I have a tilted uterus so this procedure was very risky for me, and they were unsuccessful several times. Yet, they kept having me come it to try again. I later found out that - although it is the most profitable ultra sound for them to bill for - that it was not even necessary for me, and they could have used a more simple ultra sound. I never had my uterus (or my body in general) so torn up. \n\nI am so sorry I went to Dr. Millie Behera.\n\n*They keep getting this review removed and I keep trying to put it back.", "time" 1526330715} {"author_name" "Jennifer Felts", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109968009634014247986/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-r61qrQ6NxiM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXCIoj_YvWEM17OMF8CBl3qwPFhJ0g/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "3 months ago", "text" "I cannot say enough about Dr. Behera and the entire staff at Bloom Reproductive.

I also really, really love that she thinks logically for me in times where maybe I didn't think it all the way through. I really feel she has our best interest in this process and I'm thankful for that. I must say that Nikki is definitely a wonderful asset to Bloom as she is so thorough and always just has a pleasant, friendly and attentive attitude with each and every one of the patients I have seen her interact with by far. Kudos to you, Nik! 😁 I recently had a procedure done and Lindsay was Dr. Woodford assistant during this time at the Scottsdale location. I must say, Lindsay, in my experience dealing with her, is the total opposite of Nikki. I fell she lacked enthusiasm and friendliness. She has a very reserved mannerism about herself and this is an exciting time for anyone in this stage in life in attempting to have a baby and so it would have been nice to have the same approach from someone that was assisting a new Doctor in the area. Also, she didn't fully disclose all the details regarding symptoms I may experience after the procedure which cost me a lot of distress being that I was really concerned 😟. Would have saved me a lot of grief had she been a little bit more thorough in explaining.

To me it meant that she was doing something right. Once you have a plan set for your treatment then you primarily see the Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant for treatment but they were great. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the billing can be a bit difficult. They aren't always as responsive unless you are in the office. My only negative experience with them was after a treatment in office where I was supposed to be calm with no stress after I was asked to see the finance person who wanted payment that day.

The entire staff was friendly, and Debbie at the front desk was great at answering any questions we had regarding insurance. I cannot say enough great things about this office. Dr. Abuzeid didn't make me feel rushed, and was very patient. He took his time to make sure we left the office after each appointment with him, aware of what our next step would be. I was discharged from them today, after our first ultrasound confirming that I am 7 weeks pregnant with our little miracle. I cried leaving them.

Now my gums had to heal again. Now they finally started with the complete set of dentures. When they were finished, I told them that they did not fit correctly. I was told to put more poligrip. That did not work. If I bit on the left side the right top denture would come down and the same for the left top if I bit down on the right. After 11 months the top dentures broke in half. The dental school said that I would have to go through the whole process again and PAY again. I went to the school because of cost as I am retired and not rich.

We received bills on top of bills because she took the deductible and was sending over $60,000 in claims! Second, we decided to do an egg donor cycle. First they stated it wasn't covered by insurance, so we decided to do a shared cycle to split some of the cost. Literally a day before the cycle started, Tami called to tell us it was covered and we didn't have to do a shared cycle. This was a very emotional decision for us to decide. We had the choice to still donate and we did out of the goodness of our hearts. We were told we were the priority and the recipient was to get half of the eggs retrieved, any odd number, we would get more since I was the donor and I was the priority. Come to find out, they slipped up and mentioned in the exam room, out of the odd number of eggs retrieved, we got 8 and they got 10!

However, in early 2017 - I desperately scoured the internet in search of recent experiences related to reversals performed by Dr. Silber. I couldn’t find much after 2012. I have come to the conclusion that the majority of couples do not want to talk about something like this publicly - more so when the results are not what you had hoped for.\n\nMy husband had a vasectomy reversal 13 months ago. Our 4, 7 and 12 month semen analysis (SA) were all zero. No sperm seen. We are in contact with 3 couples who had their reversals by Dr. Silber relatively close to ours - give or take a few months. All showing no sperm seen thus far and they were also one sided reconnections.\n\nOne of the big areas of concern for us was communication. We had placed the $2,000 deposit to schedule surgery over the phone. I called soon after placing the deposit to request a date change and was told by Jan the date could not be changed to any other day or we lose the 2k.. regardless of reason. Keep in mind, we were still 2 months ahead of the surgery date as well. We went ahead with the original surgery date as planned. We had a phone consultation the day before surgery and Dr. Silber was highly optimistic. Vasectomy was right under 6 years old and this would be my husband’s first attempt ever having it reversed. Nothing was ever mentioned during consultation that Dr. Silber only reconstructs one side now and not both. $11,000 we paid not including travel expenses for one side. We didn’t find out about the one side situation until my husband woke up from anesthesia. After arriving home, I called the office to see what happened and why the right side was not attempted. Was informed by Dena that Dr. Silber no longer connects the second side if he feels the first side had a perfect reconnection. Interesting - this was news to us and never mentioned to us prior.\n\nIncision was large - approximately 5 inches. Healed with no complications, no bruising, and very minimal swelling if any at all. My husband was sore for an extended amount of time, but healing process went great. He took two weeks off work and did no lifting of anything over 10lbs (not even a grocery bag) for 4 weeks. Also no ‘releasing’ until 4 weeks post op. Followed all drs orders.\n\nWhat hurts the most is a false sense of hope. SA after SA we were just told it can take 12 months for sperm to return by Dr. Silber’s office. Was also informed by his office after month 7 SA, (no sperm seen) that Dr. Silber reviewed the notes from surgery and he thought we had a great chance for sperm return. We were also quoted a patency success rate of 95% during our consultation, but he really didn’t see us falling in that 5%. After getting the post-op report - we found out it didn’t appear to be a great chance for success at all. Our vasoepididymostomy (VE) was connected at the head of the epididymis which based on what little knowledge we do have about this sort of thing.. that’s a worst case scenario. That was not mentioned either.\n\nThe hospital itself was fantastic. All the staff there were amazing! I really felt my husband was safe in their care, but at the end of the day - opening this door to a vasectomy reversal has been heartbreaking and expensive for an incomplete procedure.", "time" 1524668611} {"author_name" "Christina Carnahan", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103417928431258676295/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P9MSAN0990I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXDPIQNHMmfIyoiSU6yRpceSndmOmA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "4 months ago", "text" "We are extremely grateful for Dr. Silber and his team for providing us with the opportunity to have children.

We were very comfortable throughout the process because we always knew what was next. We were always told in great detail of what was happening now and what will happen next. It was very reassuring to know what laid ahead of us and to know that there was always someone there to guide us and answer any questions we had. \n\nWe will be forever thankful for Dr. Silber and everything he and the wonderful folks at St. Luke’s have done for us.

Now they had a lawyer send us paperwork, (a lawyer I’m sure cost more than $500, just to show they’re petty ness) because I said I would not be paying until I was sent documentation as to what we owed.

"text" "My wife and I went to this place for all of the testing.  On the surface they \"appeared\" to be knowledgeable about their work. The problem is when it comes for billing. They do not know if they are coming or going. We went there 3 different times, and recieved 3 different prices.  The pricing was more by a few thousand each time.  We then called ARC which they recommended for financing. When ARC came back with pricing, that they confirmed with this place, it was again $2k more than the last quote.  We figured if they don't know what they're doing when it comes to billing, they probably don't know what they're doing when it comes to anything else, so we declined.  Also, when we received our payment plan from ARC, who specializes in this type of loan, the interest rate was 12.99%.  This is with good credit!!!  We then received a surprise bill in the mail, for services we were told were taken care of by our insurance.  In the real world if you're wrong, you eat your mistake.  Not the case with this place.

It's not about babies in the waiting room playing, crying, or otherwise making noise. It's about patients going in to find out that day for them, there may be no hope. Someone may just have been told that their results indicate that pregnancy is not possible at all, or that the heartbeat that they had 3 days days ago had ceased.\n\nWhen i was told my pregnancy had unfortunately ended, and there was no longer a heartbeat, i appreciated the sensitivity of not having children in the waiting area.

We had been going to a fancy (and extremely expensive) clinic in downtown Seattle and after 7 failed IUI cycles felt like we were at the end of our 7 year infertilely journey. We were recommended to Bellingham IVF from two people who have had successful IVF cycles with them.  At first, I was a little hesitant because of the fact I had seen a few bad reviews online but as soon as I met with Dr. Brannigan I knew we were in the right place. The whole 9 months we were seen at the clinic I never once felt mislead or misinformed, I truly felt like they cared and wanted us to take home a baby rather than it being about money. Unfortunately, our first IVF transfer didn’t work, but we sat down with Dr. Brannigan to asses our situation, our drug regiment and our transfer was modified to increase our chances for the next attempt and we got pregnant!

I worked with the WONDERFULLY AMAZING staff at Gyft Clinic (including Dr. Robinette) and finally achieved my dream of becoming a mom after 2 cycles with IUI.  :-)  Our beautiful son, Nikolas was born in December 2004...and I am thankful to Gyft Clinic every single day for making this dream come true!  They are the most compassionate and understanding group of people I have ever met.  They truly make you feel like family.

He answers questions thoughtfully and spends a good amount of time with you. \n\nThe Nurses: I saw the fertility nurses more than I did my doctor in the beginning. He oversaw the process, though, and I am very comfortable with the nurses. They are very friendly and kind. Julie, Bette, and Charlene are the regular nurses that I see and they are amazing. They have a great sense of humor and are skilled at what they do. At times when I have been stressed or worried they have diffused the situation with a joke at their own expense or a kind word or touch. You can call them anytime and leave a message and expect a return call by no later than the next day. They answer any questions you have without making you feel silly for asking them.\n\nThe Receptionists: Very nice ladies. They actually remember my name when I walk in and are pleasant to deal with.\n\nBilling: I've had the opportunity to talk with Cheryl in the billing department a few times due to questions about billing and she is always very helpful. If she doesn't know what is going on right then, she will take the time to research it and get back to you, usually within 24 hours.\n\nThe Cost: Dr. Murrain started me off on the cheapest, least invasive fertility treatments and we worked our way up from there. He absolutely did not promote expensive procedures to me unless they were necessary. You can get a price sheet if you ask for it and they will do whatever they can to reduce costs for you if you tell them you are struggling. They give you your choice of companies to order medicine from which can change the price greatly.

My husband and I had been trying for almost 3 years.  After seeing Dr Stoelk, in just a few months, my husband and I are pregnant with our first child.    \n\nMy experience at Kaiser went like this.  Few months wait for OB/Gyn who had to refer me to Kaiser fertility center.  3-4 months wait to see a nurse who took my medical history.  Blood test.  3-4 months to see another fertility specialist nurse who pulled my medical history, and asked me the same question as the first nurse, laughed really hard when I sadly told her it took me 4 months to see her, and then told me I'm healthy and I should try it on my own.  Now this costed thousands of dollars...we had been trying for years...and we are approaching 40.  I cancelled my Kaiser insurance after this visit.\n\nMy experience with Dr Stoelk went like this.  First consultation included actively listening to me and doing a thorough physical exam, in which he told me I had a condition that makes it hard for me to conceive.  A conveniently scheduled laparoscopy in which the entire team was excellent, especially Dr Stoelk who took great care of me.  Couple months after--I feel so much better in general thanks to the meticulous surgery, and we are pregnant!  It was an amazing experience.  Every appointment was so carefully thought out. Everything that was done was done because it was absolutely necessary.  This place is a gem.  \n\nFor everyone who had been trying for years to be a parent, had been disappointed in fertility places who treated you carelessly, never listen, took your money, wasted your time, and treated you like a number, try this place!

We were finally ready to try to start a family again. I came across Oregon Reproductive Medicine online and was excited that they were so LGBTQ friendly. They seemed like the perfect choice for us, so we got in touch to set up a consult. \n\nThe whole process wasn't what I would call warm and friendly from the beginning; I never actually spoke to anyone on the phone, until I submitted all of our initial paperwork. I received a phone call from a nurse shortly after I scheduled who wanted to let me know that there was no reason for me to see them until I lost weight because I wasn't a candidate for IVF. The phone call really caught me off guard and I think I said as much. I was also really upset that they hadn't bothered to get to know me/us, review any of my medical information or history, or simply ask us what type of fertility help we were looking for. They simply put me in a category based on my weight. \n\nIf they had bothered to ask, they would have learned that yes, we had tried previously to get pregnant, but were unsuccessful. I chalk that up to a very stressful job and long hours. All of my tests were perfect; there was no reason to suspect infertility. We just don't have regular exposure to sperm, so that makes getting pregnant a challenge. We couldn't have afforded IVF anyway and wouldn't have gone that route, if that was our only option. \n\nAnyway, they didn't bother to ask, and I was so upset by how I was treated before we had even met with them, we decided not to make the hour and a half drive to Portland and I cancelled the appointment. We found a lovely midwife at the Corvallis Birth Center who helped us with a pre-conception check up, tracking ovulation, and she eventually did our IUI. I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant. \n\nFrankly, we're really happy that they treated us so poorly. It was the push I needed to advocate for myself and find a care provider who cared about who we were as individuals. If you're looking for a caring provider, look elsewhere.

I was called by a associate called Jessica from ORM & she said\"well we received your results & your levels aren't at 0.00 but at a low 3.675.So your pregnant.\"After 7 YEARS of infertility I've finally heard those 2 words every woman wants to hear. BUT it was short lived by her adding that the levels SHOULD be around 17 to 20m So your only KINDA pregnant.I stood their confused. What do you mean \"kind of\" pregnant?? She said they consider anything over a 2.50m a positive pregnancy but probably will turn to a negative the next time we test you.we would like you back in on Thursday 12/1/2016 to take another test to see if your levels doubled or if it dropped.) If it doubles or rises you are for sure pregnant.If it goes down unfortunately that means your not pregnant.I shook my head in shock & asked \"you just told me Im pregnant\" but actually not?She said because your not at 0.0 (which would mean I'm not pregnant) but above 2.50m they \"consider\" me pregnant. I told her thank you & hung up so distraught,& emotional my happy moment I've been begging, praying, dreaming of has come and gone & has been RUINED by ORM. \nThe last 2 days to vie had to wait for the next blood test to confirm again has been horrible and emotional.My husband and I went in again today and spent more money to take another blood test.Also while I was there I requested for someone to call me so I can discuss my issues i'm having with ORM so far.I was given a call around 9:30am and the lady was nice and said we can discuss your results and if you want to reschedule a different time to talk about the issues your having with ORM I completely understand & I said,well it depends on my results.She said \"well Elizabeth I'm sorry to tell you,your levels dropped to a 1.37m & that means your not pregnant\".I told her how DARE you guys tell me I'm pregnant when im not.What kind of policies is this.I told your her you guys are ORM, your on the radio, news, all over the internet, a state, even country known for reproductive medicine and have had hundreds of positive stories and this is how I'm treated?Your associate tells me the news I've wanted to hear for almost 7 years this December and now but I'm actually not?I told her do you even understand my story and that we have been trying this long and what this has put me through? she remained calm the whole call and understanding.She did say 3 different things, I could of been pregnant, the egg implanted, then detached.Then it was and chemical pregnancy from all my medicines raised my levels and made them think I was pregnant.Then I could of not been pregnant at all.I said your associate had the audacity to tell me I was pregnant when you weren't even sure yourself \nSo I spend over $172.00 the past 2 visits for them to tell me I'm pregnant but no I'm not. She also added this is a hard to tell our clients news like this and very sorry. And I said HARD FOR YOU. I'm the one going through the shots, pills, mood swings, depression, weight gain, cravings, stress at work and home, and so on and it's hard for you? This all could of been prevented if you didn't tell me I was pregnant when I actually wasn't. I also asked her why you tell people your pregnant at such a low level when I told her i don't mean to question her schooling, job or position but I I checked Google, & a positive pregnancy shouldn't be considered a positive test until over 5.0m so why did they consider a number at 3.675 a positive. She said their job is the find out early with procedures & their goal is to find out as soon as possible.

Any time I had a question or concern she had an answer.  She is also witty and funny which sets the tone for a happy experience. I always felt comfortable and safe with Dr. Ratcliffe. Bonnie the IVF coordinator is wonderful! She is along for the ride with you 100%. She was there to answer all of my important and trivial questions and ease my mind of every concern. She was very responsive (within several hours) to e-mail and phone calls and never seemed to tire of responding to my endless stream of inquiries. Ashley at the front desk always greeted us cheerfully with a smile and was available to help with appointments and payments. I know there are several other members of the team behind the scenes that I didn't work with directly but contributed to my awesome experience. I am grateful for these wonderful people!! At my final appointment I had a difficult time saying goodbye. It hit me right in the feels. I can't wait for my next round of IVF just so I can see everyone again!

This is not my first time being an egg donor, and so I had certain expectations (which were all unfulfilled). I recently found out that this place tried to slander my name by complaining about me to my agency, and claiming that I was 'Non-compliant'. Well then. Here goes all the frustration I've been trying so hard to keep repressed all this time.\nFirst off, this place is the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL clinic I have ever had to deal with. I don't live in the Bay Area, so there were tons of appointments that I had to attend to in a third-party, 'monitoring' clinic (my local clinic). My coordinator essentially made me play messenger and schedule all my appointments with the local clinic (this was supposed to be her job, NOT MINE--I know this because of my previous experience in being a donor) and they'd only notify me of these appointments I had to schedule myself for literally the night before--there was once when I was notified only 2 HOURS' in advance. I had to drop everything I had planned for the day, because I was so damn COMPLIANT and just rushed to the clinic (a 2-hour journey) even though I hadn't slept or eaten the entire day. I was literally crying because I was so frustrated with their lack of professionalism. This happened way more than once, too. I simply could not make it to some of these ridiculously-last-minute appointments because, duh, I have a schedule? And they had the cheek to claim that I was non-compliant! On my previous cycle with La Jolla IVF, I never ONCE had to play messenger between them and my monitoring clinic. Everything was always pre-arranged IN ADVANCE.\nAnother issue was that this place was supposed to let my agency know when my supposed retrieval date was, so they could arrange my flight & accommodation. Well, lo and behold, turns out they never did (at this point, I wasn't surprised at all), and I had to let my own agency know (again, me playing messenger because this clinic wasn't doing its job), and at this point my flight & accommodation reservations were made literally the day before, and my options were very limited. I had to settle for the worst possible flight times & accommodation options. I was SO upset that I had to settle for staying in a crappy 'hotel' when it was in no way my fault. This would not have been the case had this clinic been more proactive with actually communicating with my agency. Again, this was not a problem for my previous cycle with La Jolla IVF. When I told the doctor (Dr Purcell) which hotel I had to stay in, even she was disgusted. Obviously I didn't tell her that it was her own clinic's fault that I had to compromise so much because of their incompetency. This hotel had spiders crawling all over and whatnot, so you get the picture. Saying that it was a far cry from the hotel I stayed in for my previous cycle would be a huge understatement. I sucked it up and breathed in the spider-infested air every night.\nThen comes the day of the retrieval. After the procedure, the nurse kept nagging at me to 'Wake up! Wake up!' with a tone of marked annoyance because I was still groggy from the anesthesia. I forced myself to get up even though at this point I was still stumbling around and had difficulty walking. Then, they literally CHASED ME OUT like I was some annoying pestilence they couldn't wait to get rid of. Never saw the doctor again after, nor did she ever attempt to check up on me. It was obvious they didn't care (The name of this clinic is pretty ironic). I was told by the front desk that someone would call to check up on me the day after, but nope. No word from them again after. I was not given ANY post-surgery aftercare instructions--not even anything about the warning signs of OHSS, what to expect, or how to reduce bloating. Nothing. Had I not known what to expect from my previous cycle, I probably would've gone to the ER or died or whatever. In La Jolla IVF, the doctor actually took some time to see me in person post-surgery, and gave me detailed aftercare instructions.", "time" 1464955713}], "id" "eb3e439bad8d9f94c906b81cb1af8c71a9e5f327", "adr_address" "<span class=\"street-address\">555 Knowles Dr Suite 212</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Los Gatos</span>, <span class=\"region\">CA</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">95032</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>", "types" ["doctor" "health" "point_of_interest" "establishment"], "utc_offset" -420, "place_id" "ChIJIcxylQs1joARAZvYrdvcn8c", "name" "CARE for the Bay Area", "geometry" {"location" {"lat" 37.2623486, "lng" -121.9661148}, "viewport" {"northeast" {"lat" 37.2633382302915, "lng" -121.9647571197085}, "southwest" {"lat" 37.2606402697085, "lng" -121.9674550802915}}}, "scope" "GOOGLE", "reference" "CmRSAAAAhvGOcqx0xhNlLd3YQQEA8WLrQbh84dExBIB-0PJ31-Su-JpHYEsvzWnPmUE-99htoI_9_8vzDdnOaVWbd8W1insfMnV9PAEqSiNLePWXbB1zCFM6wo-IUIH7ALYi15l9EhCiELVE1LaBiPMhPNfFC8b8GhS2-kKrxDZA8f-UQ8U5hwnal-F0XQ", "rating" 3.7, "formatted_address" "555 Knowles Dr Suite 212, Los Gatos, CA 95032, USA", "vicinity" "555 Knowles Drive Suite 212, Los Gatos", "international_phone_number" "+1 408-628-0783", "icon" "https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png", "address_components" [{"long_name" "Suite 212", "short_name" "Suite 212", "types" ["subpremise"]} {"long_name" "555", "short_name" "555", "types" ["street_number"]} {"long_name" "Knowles Drive", "short_name" "Knowles Dr", "types" ["route"]} {"long_name" "Los Gatos", "short_name" "Los Gatos", "types" ["locality" "political"]} {"long_name" "Santa Clara County", "short_name" "Santa Clara County", "types" ["administrative_area_level_2" "political"]} {"long_name" "California", "short_name" "CA", "types" ["administrative_area_level_1" "political"]} {"long_name" "United States", "short_name" "US", "types" ["country" "political"]} {"long_name" "95032", "short_name" "95032", "types" ["postal_code"]}]}, :address "555 Knowles Drive", :phone "(408) 628-0783", :name "C.A.R.E for the Bay Area", :city "Los Gatos", :longitude "-121.966", :state "CA", :zipcode "95032", :place-id "ChIJIcxylQs1joARAZvYrdvcn8c", :latitude "37.2621"} {:all-details {"url" "https://maps.google.com/?cid=13780197182896806986", "formatted_phone_number" "(702) 722-2229", "website" "http://greenvalleyfertility.com/", "reviews" [{"author_name" "Ms. Jewel", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105211866554580371009/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-STni7cYedKQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXA5uNbkNQzhPBX_F4ZOX1d8c1-D2A/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "2 weeks ago", "text" "One of the very tiny few(count on one hand) of The SMARTEST, MOST EDUCATED and REPUTABLE Doctor around the Vegas valley in general.

I knew others who went to RRF with great results but I was hesitant and was already going to another office in the Vegas area. I am very glad I switched! RRF has more of a personalized feel than others in my opinion. Other offices had a “smoke and mirrors” feeling to it and RRF did not. They(all staff and doctor) are honest, upfront, personal and down to earth all wanting the same goal and outcome rooting for this along side of you. I appreciated how relaxed and patient connected Dr. Littman was instead of how other doctors made me feel in the whole process. With other doctors it was always in a doctor tone on a different level with the feeling of being another numbered patient. This was not the case with Dr. Littman. From the first meeting she took her time and listened to me and my history and goals. The appointment was like meeting with a friend, relaxed and natural, and her explanations were not doctor talk but person to person understanding. Another benefit about RRF is all blood work, exams, and other procedure steps are done in one location which makes it an even better experience at an already stressful time. After driving 3hours one way for an appointment, sometimes late, I was already stressed but the staff were very welcoming, understanding, and positive and it turned my day around. They answered any questions I had and corresponded by phone, email, and patient portal which helps when you are trying to work during the entire process. I would recommend RRF to anyone who wants a personal experience with well trained staff and doctor!", "time" 1526566186} {"author_name" "Stay Chic With Asmaa", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109083292180381191322/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-x6YGKavKB9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAQo/NU4kzOdBtiY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 1, "relative_time_description" "2 weeks ago", "text" "Dr. Littman is cold and had bad bed side manners. From the moment we met with her all her concerns is to get us out of her office. She answers the questions briefly and shows no compassion towards her patients. She never knew my name and always had to look at my chart twice to answer. To make things worse she diagnosed me with PCOS, which I did not have. On the top to that she recommended up to 3-6 IUI treatments before trying the IVF. She wanted to get as much money as she could from us knowing that my insurance covers up to a certain amount in a life time. Thank god I found Dr. Geoffrey Sher at the Sher institute who is warm, compassionate and cares about his patients and actually spends time answering questions that the patient has. I had one IUI treatment with Dr. Littman and of course it failed. I emailed her coordinator to cancel my pregnancy test appointment since i have gotten my period and all she responded was, \"oh no! When you are ready for the next cycle contact us please\" not a call from the doctor, NOTHING! Until today! Dr. Sher looked at my chart from red rock and told me based on the results I had a 40 year old woman's levels, and I was 27 and i could menopause in less then 10 years! After retesting with Dr Sher we found nothing abnormal! And i did not have PCOS! He suspected endometriosis but gave me the option to go in and find out or have a cycle! I was impatient so i wanted to start immediately! Thanks to Dr Sher and his amazing staff who dont get mad for me calling in to ask questions, I am now 7 weeks pregnant with twins! Thank you Dr littman for wasting my time and insurance money, being so cold that i was scared to ask questions! And making me feel like you were doing me a favor. Horrible Dr and few staff members were rude as well, Nadine always got annoyed with me every time i called her for questions, and i really did not appreciate me calling 20 times before her highness returns a call to get frustrated when patients ask questions.

After 17 visits with them, I am expecting twins! Let me start from the beginning. The office is super fancy. You walk in and there is a waterfall next to the staircase, a huge modern chandelier in the lobby and massage chairs in the waiting room. The entire staff is so friendly. You never have to wait long to be called back either!\n\nYour first appointment will be a consult and then they will go over with you what testing they recommend to determine why you can't conceive. They break everything down so you know exactly what each kind of test is and they tell you what your out of pocket expense is for everything up front. Everything is made very clear. They send you home with a folder and instructions about when and where to do each type of test. After all of the testing is complete, you will have a follow up with Dr Littman who will give you your results and give you the best course of action to get you pregnant!\n\nIn my case, that was a medicated IUI with injectable medication, since I had already tried clomid with no success. I got set up with an IUI treatment coordinator, Joanne, who is the nicest, most patient person on the planet. Throughout the couple of months that I worked with her I had about a million questions, and some that I felt like needed answers NOW. I'm sure I was not the easiest patient to deal with, but Joanne was always amazing. Dr Littman did the actual IUI procedures. I didn't spend much of the time that I spent at Red Rock with Dr Littman, because most of your appointments are with ultrasound techs, but I never felt like we weren't getting the medical attention we needed. It took me two IUI's to conceive, but I am now 14 weeks with TWINS!\n\nWe are so grateful to Dr Littman and the entire staff at Red Rock. I really wish we had gone to Red Rock sooner.

I have so much faith that this year I will be able to get pregnant with the help of my Doctor and all the girls that are always willing to help.\n\nThank you to Dr. Severino for all his help.\n I know this year my husband dreams and my dreams will come true of being parents\nAraceli Johnson", "time" 1488398339} {"author_name" "Jeff A Kinney", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100224971222360740121/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zhQIKYXE5T8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXC9KOk2SIhbWC93T7n6F9IoYL3dzQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "9 months ago", "text" "Awesome professional patient staff very happy with the way me and my wife were treated ", "time" 1502493672}], "opening_hours" {"open_now" false, "periods" [{"close" {"day" 1, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 1, "time" "0900"}} {"close" {"day" 2, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 2, "time" "0900"}} {"close" {"day" 3, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 3, "time" "0900"}} {"close" {"day" 4, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 4, "time" "0900"}} {"close" {"day" 5, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 5, "time" "0900"}}], "weekday_text" ["Monday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM" "Tuesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM" "Wednesday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM" "Thursday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM" "Friday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM" "Saturday: Closed" "Sunday: Closed"]}, "id" "d1967b94c8fd1e680b7ce897915b70f1457c7da8", "adr_address" "<span class=\"street-address\">5320 S Rainbow Blvd #300</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span class=\"region\">NV</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">89118</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>", "types" ["doctor" "health" "point_of_interest" "establishment"], "utc_offset" -420, "place_id" "ChIJq3xJUgHHyIAR3bzbehNBLjc", "name" "Sher Institute-Reproductive", "geometry" {"location" {"lat" 36.0917719, "lng" -115.2424573}, "viewport" {"northeast" {"lat" 36.09311693029149, "lng" -115.2413384697085}, "southwest" {"lat" 36.09041896970849, "lng" -115.2440364302915}}}, "scope" "GOOGLE", "reference" "CmRRAAAAcVgV59GH_5_SNM7lLU3vc8bJSG9ffmZvj14PRt7OWALlCrawe0NOEcL6LF4LV3ozQXNxVbs0UqgapgJHi9Fy5bTB089pwVBZf8jFuFWsddOOCQ1w_kRPRrd8KO5NKzenEhBQU3BxyC1pxA92kVRQvkZJGhRFK3jvl-vafkyqMceGUmEaF4o4nA", "photos" [{"height" 326, "html_attributions" ["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107649151750655303717/photos\">Sher Institute-Reproductive</a>"], "photo_reference" "CmRaAAAAy73pHAuhgghDbQUiJCchW4pDjH9ARgGZRVIFg67H4acH0baDLp9BeVikE6HiNaUZuHdnqOPVOf17I6nIh3wy1ZC7RHTqbE9i2tV-O4IPniHOHogwTGsC6jJpUKWVUvAmEhDIULxkTndDWcz3GKcHYgSGGhR8NKzmK2pGtRRa4FtEUkvC78z0kg", "width" 750} {"height" 384, "html_attributions" ["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107649151750655303717/photos\">Sher Institute-Reproductive</a>"], "photo_reference" "CmRaAAAAfwT90Im8VGjnaKsGVmo9B0XsQ21UBiZjgeOhmaE0KNm73FL4s5CKx9E0Z-19e7SaNM2ycPdwj6eWu55FGtzer42BqDUtPw7nhYQnUrmGT6gFFl4qfiLyinG-NNHUzLEaEhBiWcyK7sddVYZlYJn3yPsJGhRtVtCr3evu8wXlc7C1NnZoZe9yOQ", "width" 576} {"height" 630, "html_attributions" ["<a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps/contrib/107649151750655303717/photos\">Sher Institute-Reproductive</a>"], "photo_reference" "CmRaAAAAmO0oeUzdT25bx775QTe1THruS6K-0-1gDVnMNd5IH_dXg5lzC77owxmK5XBFoHHUiqfxG2WHgE2RCjKkmXBdMf6Ul96iohyeKhbE2vuH4K8wiyUHpy90Me7r0rZUM_bkEhAdhQ_3Lqe-h1D8-MfN9ToNGhSyBqwvhLqbXW1Ibs-dILsmr9QOnA", "width" 450}], "rating" 3.6, "formatted_address" "5320 S Rainbow Blvd #300, Las Vegas, NV 89118, USA", "vicinity" "5320 South Rainbow Boulevard #300, Las Vegas", "international_phone_number" "+1 702-892-9696", "icon" "https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png", "address_components" [{"long_name" "300", "short_name" "300", "types" ["subpremise"]} {"long_name" "5320", "short_name" "5320", "types" ["street_number"]} {"long_name" "South Rainbow Boulevard", "short_name" "S Rainbow Blvd", "types" ["route"]} {"long_name" "Las Vegas", "short_name" "Las Vegas", "types" ["locality" "political"]} {"long_name" "Clark County", "short_name" "Clark County", "types" ["administrative_area_level_2" "political"]} {"long_name" "Nevada", "short_name" "NV", "types" ["administrative_area_level_1" "political"]} {"long_name" "United States", "short_name" "US", "types" ["country" "political"]} {"long_name" "89118", "short_name" "89118", "types" ["postal_code"]}]}, :address "5320 S.

After spending two years with RCC and two years with my new clinic, I can say the difference is night and day. \n\nThe good: \nI’m grateful for the expert surgery I received from Dr. Hatasaka to correct my septate uterus. He did a wonderful job, and from what I’ve heard, he’s the best in the state for this type of work. \n\nThe bad: \nI thought the indifference (and sometimes flat-out rudeness) of the staff was just something I’d have to deal with when working with a specialist. I thought it was normal to leave messages and never hear back. I thought it was normal to wait an hour for the specialist. IT’S NOT. \n\nI started to become frustrated when Dr. Hataska refused to try other treatment besides more surgery to treat my recurrent miscarriages. I begged to have my hormones tested. I asked about IVF. I desperately inquired about small things like baby aspirin to prevent blood clotting. “No, no, no. That won’t help with recurrent miscarriage. All old wives tales,” he insisted. The only possible thing for us to do was keep trying and miscarrying until something stuck or have more surgeries. \n\nThe final straw for me was when I had my third miscarriage. I came in to have an ultrasound to confirm the miscarriage. I can’t remember whether it was Dr. Blauer or Dr. Heiner who performed the ultrasound (I believe it was Heiner). As he confirmed the miscarriage, I began to cry—obviously devastated. I will never forget what he said: “Why are you crying? This isn’t a big deal. People miscarry all the time and go on to have babies eventually.” How insensitive can you be? I left that day and never came back. \n\nFast forward: \nAfter a year or so to heal from our awful experience, we decided to give Utah Fertility Center a chance. WOW! So much better. Like, night and day. I came to realize that the treatment I received at RCC wasn’t personalized. Dr. Hatasaka was set in his ways, and we didn’t know any better. At our new practice, we were immediately tested for a bunch of different issues. RCC never even bothered to do a sperm sample analysis on my husband—let alone any genetic testing, autoimmune testing, etc.—for the two years we were there. Turns out, this is all part of a normal infertility workup for people who have a difficult time getting pregnant (as we were) or miscarry (as we were). \n\nPeople: you don’t have to put up with terrible treatment. You don’t have to put up with doctors who take the easy (for them) path. You don’t have to deal with insensitive doctors who chastise you for crying. There are doctors who will fight infertility alongside you and be your advocate. Unfortunately, from my experience, they’re not at RCC.  \n\nThanks to our new clinic, we’re now expecting our first baby this fall. What did the trick? Hormone treatments, baby aspirin, and IVF. I guess they aren't old wives tales after all.", "time" 1526442570}], "opening_hours" {"open_now" false, "periods" [{"close" {"day" 1, "time" "1700"}, "open" {"day" 1, "time" "0800"}} {"close" {"day"

I understand this is super uncommon, but it is still something that they should have checked for, especially before doing an IUI which was expensive, or starting progesterone because starting it too early will prevent pregnancy.

Our second was born Nov 2017.* I feel terrible seeing all of the poor reviews on here. Fertility issues really do bring out the most raw, painful emotions in a person; I truly do feel for all those who turned to ICRM in their most desperate times and still were not able to conceive. My wife and I are a same-sex couple who obviously needed medical assistance conceiving. We assumed that I had no fertility issues going in, but even with careful timing, medications, switching donors, and lots of support, it still took 6 IUIs to finally conceive our son. Throughout the process I felt nothing but love and support from the entire ICRM staff. There were hugs and tears when our first IUI ended in a chemical pregnancy and hugs and tears the day we \"graduated\" from the fertility clinic. The staff there does absolutely everything within their power to help you have a baby. I felt like they wanted it just as badly for us as we wanted it for ourselves. Our phone calls were always returned on the same day, and we got in for a same-day appointment on several occasions- even once when I was just freaking myself out and needed to see that heartbeat on the ultrasound. The staff was always very helpful. I'm happy to announce that we now have a beautiful baby boy, born in December, 2015. Even though we now live closer to a fertility center in Utah, we look forward to working with The Idaho Center for Reproductive Medicine again when it's time for a sibling. It will be well worth the travel time. I would recommend them to anyone. To those of you who have yet to conceive: sending you lots of love and baby dust!

And many instances where they talked to me having not reviewed my chart and seemed clueless as to my plan or course of treatment. And you can NEVER reach a nurse right away.. You always have to leave a message regardless of what's happening. I had two miscarriages under their care. In the end they had no answers as to why it wasn't working.. by all accounts I was fine.

Everything is explained and the entire staff is knowledgeable and professional. There is a complete lack of communication at aspire and depending upon who you ask is what answer you'll get.\nAspire also tried to charge me out of pocket for procedures that my insurance does in fact cover.

"text" "The infertility road can be a very lonely, hopeless, and stressful one. IVF is usually the last resort or only bit of hope most couples have after trying all other options first, or being diagnosed with something untreatable that requires IVF. So choosing a fertility doctor is one of the most important factors, if not THE most important factor, when it comes to IVF success. My husband was diagnosed with severe male infertility factor at 3 million sperm per cc. We thought about doing the varicocele surgery to correct it, but it was unlikely that the semen quality would improve enough after varicocele repair to result in pregnancy without inseminations or IVF. So, something that could have been a simple fix wasn’t so simple after all because of the numbers, so we decided to stop wasting time and go straight to IVF. We chose Dr. Kavoussi because I didn’t want to go to the huge fertility center in town that everyone else goes to because I wanted it to feel more personal. As SOON as we met Dr. Kavoussi at our consultation, we knew we had made the right choice. His calm and confident disposition really comforted us and he explained everything that we would be going through in very great detail with such knowledge and expertise that we were blown away. After that first consultation, with much thanks to the extremely competent office staff and other nurses, getting everything else set up was an easy process. We got phone calls along the way describing the next steps (and yes, there are a lot of them!) and all of our questions were answered each time, without us even having to ask. Kate and everyone else at Westlake IVF made sure to make us feel like they were all invested in our outcome. We ended up being able to retrieve 24 eggs, and 16 fertilized. Out of those 16, 9 made it to blastocyst stage which made us happy beyond belief. On the day of our embryo transfer, we were the only ones there along with the medical staff. It was on a Sunday and I remember thinking, wow, this clinic is open solely for us right now. Fast forward to now, and I am 12 weeks pregnant and can’t believe I am even typing that! I am BEYOND happy to have chosen such an amazing facility and group of people to help us achieve our dream of a baby.

We were kept waiting for quite a while and the doctor seemed to treat us like we were a number. We had never even tried Clomid and she suggested IUI, acting like that was our only option. (I've since had a new Ob/GYN and fertility specialist who BOTH said, in the most professional way possible, that this treatment was not medically necessary for us and was really a way to get more money). We are now pregnant from ONE round of 50 mg of Clomid. I have a friend who saw Dr. Doody as well who was recommended unnecessary surgery and IVF( quoted to her at a price 3X more expensive than anywhere else). She is now pregnant from ONE round of Clomid and ONE IUI procedure. I'm just going to say when you are looking for answers and you go somewhere where they spend just as long with you in the financing area as you do in the doctor's office it's probably not a good fit.

Our initial visit wasn't the best...the office is a bit older, not very warm/comforting, the staff wasn't the friendliest, and our visit with the doctor felt very rushed even though we had dozens of questions left unanswered.  Our visit was discouraging and we weren't given much hope, even with the option of IVF.  We went a second time and left feeling the same:  hopeless. \n Because of that we postponed all fertility treatments for two years!  I wish then we had really got a second opinion right away.  \n\nAfter our new doctor reviewed our records, we were told several of their \"recommendations,\" including surgery, were completely unnecessary.  Their pricing for IVF was DOUBLE the price with our new doctor.  Even upon having them fax our records to our new doctor, that took weeks!  I finally reached a nice lady in the office who got the job done.  We were also told their semen analyses are done by machine and the results aren't as accurate as having an actual technician do so.  If you have been to this clinic and feel discouraged to move forward, I encourage you to get a second opinion.  Try looking at DFW's Top 4 infertility doctors & don't give up!  For the amount of money you're spending and the stress you're going through, it's worth it to find a doctor that fits your needs.  There are other doctors out there who want to see you have a family and who aren't in it just for a profit.  You shouldn't feel like another number and you should feel welcome!  Our current doctor knows us by name, calls us with every update, personally greets us even when we're there just for labs, and gets us in immediately when necessary since infertility is so time sensitive.

We worked with Dr. McKinney for over a year, and throughout the entire process, were provided nothing but incomplete information and frustration.  To be clear, this review and our experience would be the same regardless of the outcome.  We did not get pregnant after 2 cycles of IVF, but I’ve been planning to write this review regardless of the outcome.  \nI am very surprised at the number of positive reviews for TFC because our experience was mostly frustrating.  We had started IUI cycles before we moved to Oklahoma, and our initial impression of TFC was very positive due to their organized process.  Unfortunately, that process is not flexible for those who have already undergone treatments elsewhere.  Problems with starting their treatment after starting at another clinic was the beginning of our tiresome journey, and I wish we had moved to a different clinic when these problems first arose.  \nAt our initial visit, we were instructed to complete our lab work and then we’d be able to schedule our treatment.  After not hearing back for two weeks, the nurse asked me to schedule a follow-up visit, which we had been told we didn’t need to do.  In addition, I was assured that all of our previous records had been received, but in this two-week-later communication, was told that in fact, not all of the records were received.  TFC was missing my most recent pap smear and my boyfriend’s test results.  You would think that it would be simple for one professional to be in contact with another to ensure that all these records had been received.  Instead, I wasn’t notified until two weeks after-the-fact, after being told that everything had been received, that they were missing my Pap smear result.  In all, it took 6 weeks and at least 10-20 phone calls on my part to get that last little bit of information transferred, which of course, delayed our treatment for two months.  It’s entirely possible that these were my last fertile months; my bloodwork afterward showed a decreased hormone level.  \nLike many of the reviews indicate, the staff seems very nice, but they are fairly insensitive.  I underwent many IUIs and two IVFs without any significant pain, so I’m not a wimp.  However, there was one procedure after which I experienced such extreme cramping, I had tears in my eyes and could barely stand up.  I hobbled out of my exam room and asked if they had any Tylenol or Advil, and not one person looked up from their computer or offered to help me up front.  \nWe underwent several IUIs, a cancelled IVF, and a failed IVF before Dr. McKinney happened to mention that in addition to advanced maternal age and low AMH (which was normal before the two-month delay we experienced after starting with TFC), we also had a problem on the male side.  His test results indicated that he was on the very low end of the range for a particular number (but in the “normal” range according to the report we have), and we were never told that it was a problem until our post-failed-IVF appointment.  Dr. McKinney couldn’t believe that she never mentioned it, and just stated, “Well, that’s why we were doing ICSI,” but did not express any sympathy as to why were upset that we weren’t told specifically prior to that point.  \nOur final IVF cycle failed, and instead of getting a phone call (which they indicate you will receive if it fails), I found out on the portal.  Logging into the portal expecting good news (since we didn’t get a phone call), and seeing a blank egg report with the words “no viable embryos” was just beyond words.  The only good thing about having completed our cycles with TFC is that we don’t have to deal with them anymore.  If we decide to continue treatment, we will travel outside of Oklahoma.", "time" 1508697425} {"author_name" "Thai Lee", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107758684200228994616/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QmvFlPGLth4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXA8Xg6StrjaGKSVlwI6UTAIJ00u6w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "9 months ago", "text" "So far so good, this is my first fertility treatment.

I was a patient of Dr. Holoch's for well over a year, and just recently switched to a new clinic.  My husband and I are firmly in the \"unexplained\" category of infertility, which is frustrating in and of itself, but the way we were handled at this clinic made it hundreds of times worse.  Dr. Holoch is very nice, and like most clinics that I know of, much of our day to day procedure is dealt with by nurses and staff.  We went through several IUI procedures, and an unsuccessful IVF, plus many, MANY tests.  The nursing staff commonly changed hands, so when I would call about something, half the time the nurse I talked to wouldn't know what I was talking about.   Once I went in for a TSH  blood draw, and the lab tech nearly drew my blood for pregnancy (which I hadn't even started IVF treatment for yet) because they didn't know what I was in for.  When I caught the mistake, the nurse was called, and she ALSO didn't know what I was in for, even though she had ordered it.  Had I went through with that test, I would have had to come back the next day.  Another time they drew blood, they left it in the freezer and it was ruined.  They never knew how much I owed on my account, wouldn't tell me I owed anything, then call me asking for money when I didn't even know what it was for.   While the doctor was very nice, she commonly let me make the decisions, instead of telling me what I needed to do, or what she recommended.  This led to us making wrong decisions, and wasting a LOT of time and money (that we really don't have).  Overall, it was very hard to get anyone to call me back in a timely manner.  The beginning of the end for me was after my first IVF transfer.   I went in for the blood test in the morning, and they put a rush on it so I should have had a call by lunchtime.  They didn't call me at all that day.  After I called and emailed, the next morning the nurse finally called me back, and made excuses that they got the test back late and she needed to go home (apparently right at 4pm, when they got the test back?), so she couldn't call to even tell me it was negative.  I just spent $25K on a procedure, and they couldn't respect me enough to make that call when I sat by my phone and waited all day.  The last procedure I did was a mock test to check my uterus' receptivity.  This test is supposed to have results in 4 days.  3 weeks later they finally called with the results, which now I find out are worthless because they didn't put me on the medicines they should have.  Another $1K+ down the drain.  Being unable to have children is hard enough, but being treated like a number, not someone who is hurting, makes it so much worse.  \n\nSince we have switched over to the new doctor, I've already seen him once, talked to him on the phone once, he's given me his personal phone number in case I ever have issues, and they want to get started right away on treatment.  I wish I wouldn't have wasted time at the KU clinic, but we can only learn from our mistakes.", "time" 1504645111} {"author_name" "Amy Wilburn", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114045409618800312581/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5YscEap9esQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANk/TUJNbzn1kAk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "a year ago", "text" "Worked our first ivf try.

I have to nitpick a couple things to make sure you know it's an honest review. \n\nPros: \n+Competent - Always able to answer our questions and provide us with as much confidence as he could reasonably be expected to. Although our very 1st attempt resulted in pregnancy, she miscarried after about a week, so we were worried about our chances. He helped answer all our questions and remained optimistic about trying again soon! \n+Our very next attempt was also successful and the baby is healthy as can be (5 months pregnant!). \n\n+Friendly staff - All staff were friendly and professional. The atmosphere before heading in to the procedures was light with some 80s Pop I was able to goof to while we anxiously waited. \n\n+Prompt and organized! They always returned calls quickly and wait times were better than you could expect. \n\n+Fair price based on market. We didn't use the financing, but those were made available to us had we not have had the savings. \n\nCons (nit-picking):\n\nWished they had explained the difference between the genetic tests just in case we would have inclined to do one I read up about. There are 2 possible tests. \n\nBefore our miscarriage the 1st time, they left a message on my wife's voicemail right as they closed about how her levels weren't normal. She was devastated and had no way to ask any questions about how likely a miscarriage would be. Even if they would be unable to provide us with many details, I would prefer she didn't get that on a voicemail unless there was an invitation to talk to someone about the news.  We Googled like crazy and had no one to answer a question for better or worse. I think she could have called Dr Gelbach's cell, but she refused to bother him since she didn't know how serious it may be. \n\n(We did call Dr. Gelbach's cell on one occasion when the pharmaceutical distributor didn't send enough of one of the drugs, which aid the pregnancy. He assured us that he had the drugs there at the office until the shipment arrived.) Not a con, but shows you we probably should have called him when we were given the message so he could have explained the results to us that day. \n\nOverall:\n\nWe both highly recommend Dr Gelbach (Midwest Reproductive) to anyone who is considering IVF.

Naturally, I needed records shared with CCRM. This started in October. My husband and I have sent in multiple signed requests for release of his records. We have faxed the requests to ARM. We have called ARM to confirm that they received them. When they don't show up at CCRM and I call back, they snappishly tell me that they have already sent them and that they have a confirmation number (which really doesn't mean anything, they just have a timestamp that the fax supposedly went through). They have refused to call CCRM to confirm that the records were received. I've worked in healthcare my entire career--it's not that hard for them to pick up the phone and call another provider for continuation of care--which is what this is. I asked if they could provide the records to us via email so that WE could send them to CCRM, and they wanted to charge $14 for the privilege of receiving our own medical information via email (though apparently faxing is free?!).\n\nToday, my husband called again and gave them an earful about the fact that they need to take a little responsibility and call CCRM and they hung up on him. \n\nI am so beyond pissed off about how difficult they are, I wouldn't recommend them at all--they aren't that much cheaper than CCRM and they are VASTLY more difficult to work with. It is stressful enough needing to see a fertility specialist. Needing to call and beg them to share records over a four month period is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nUPDATE: They called to say they have no record of one of the test results we had done, despite the fact that one of their docs told us it was \"normal\". So they either lost our test results or they told us results that didn't actually exist.

They refuse to bill insurance for things that are covered and make you pay out of pocket.

When you call to get your money back, they give you the run around and act like they never received the payment from the insurance company. I threatened to get a lawyer, and my insurance company got involved and sent them letters demanding they give my money back. Finally, after lots of phone calls, emails, and threats, I got refunded. They are greedy and only want your money. Do not go to them if you can help it. Infertility can be very stressful and they definitely try their best to make it worse for you.

On the next attempt they neglected to tell me that I had failing motility of my sperm and therefore would need to use donor sperm. This was conveyed to me with less than 1 hour to decide. Even though they had this information for days. We couldn't even choose the donor. \nThey are typically disorganized and Dr. Troutt has weak bedside manner and when confronted about any issues, reverts to a little giggle which sounds at once condescending and incompetent. If I were you, I'd check with some other clinics before coming here.

Dr. De Pinho is our fertility doc at the clinic. He is very personable and he took time out of his busy \"baby-making\" schedule to go over all our options for determining the best outcome for our situation and our budget towards fertility treatments.. If you are in for a few laughs, he has that too. Be prepared for a few punch-lines in your consultation with Dr. De Pinho - he's quite the joker. His staff may get tired of his jokes, but my husband and I just love his sense of humor, especially given the circumstances. From start to finish, CT Fertility is simply the best.

I met with a doctor there and asked about the risk to the embryos. He told me they have a better than 95% survival rate when undergoing PGS. This was backed up by their website, which claims a 98% success rate. I went ahead. All four embryos died. Let's be clear: assuming a 98% success rate, the chance of all four dying, without negligence, is 16 in 10,000,000.\n\nNot only did they not bother to return my calls after killing my embryos (specifically, I put calls out to their clinical director, who called me back once two weeks later with no knowledge of my case at all, said she'd look into it, and never called again), but they charged me $750 to thaw the embryos. That's like hiring someone to paint your house who burns your house down, but still charges you for putting up the painter's tape.\n\nSo, here I am starting from scratch, with the time, thousands of dollars, and heartbreak involved in starting over.

I had multiple rounds of failed iui cycles then tried ivf.

The inconsistency continued right up to the day of my procedure. The doctor that saw me in the office said I should wait another day before extraction then I got a call later that day from a nurse stating my assigned doctor ( that never saw me) said I should extract immediately. The day of the extraction I was told by the doctor 5 eggs were extracted. I received a call in a few days stating none of the eggs were fertilized so of course I was confused and filled with questions to which I was told “my doctor will schedule a consultation to discuss”. When I called to schedule they told me the earliest appt they had available was 21 days later. At this appt I was then told I had “4” eggs extracted when I was first told 5. I was also then told by my doctor that I may just have “crummy” eggs. Wether true or not that could’ve definitely been said in a more professional and delicate manner. I decided I could not spend any more time or money in an office that I had completely lost trust and confidence in so I decided to go to Georgia Reproductive Specialist. Once I switched offices I got pregnant on my 2nd IUI cycle and did not have to go through IVF (my “crummy” eggs were just fine:-). No paperwork glitches, no inconsistencies , you are assigned 1 doctor that manages your treatment so it’s very personalized and all flows smoothly.

Everyone is professional and kind.  I am only giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 for 2 reasons. First, I chose the Marietta location for my services.  Of course there are some services that are only available at the main office in Atlanta and that is understandable.  However, my issue was that I found that there were also MANY MANY times on weekdays when the Marietta office (which just happens to be 15-20 minutes from my home-super convenient) was not even available for routine blood work or ultrasounds.  So I either had to make the long early morning drive to Atlanta or when it was acceptable to do so, I would have to postpone these tests to a later date.  I will say that staff were never unkind or short on patience with my frustration about having to reschedule. \nSecondly, when I had my initial consultation with the doctor it was explained to me in detail that my chances of achieving pregnancy and a live birth at the age of 44 with my own eggs was very low even with IVF and nearly impossible without fertility assistance.  I appreciated the doctor's candidness with what statistics were for my age range but I never could come to grips with the fact that it really never seemed to make a difference in those statistics that my blood work revealed much better odds including good hormone levels, egg reserve, etc.  Because of those odds we opted to not 'waste' our money on the IVF (we were told that even with IVF odds were only 3% in our favor and we didn't have $50-$100k to spend on multiple attempts to increase our odds when things failed after the 1st attempt).  We already have one son and one of our reasons for inquiring about IVF because of frequent miscarriages in the past but we were also hoping to have the option to choose gender and as most people we hoped for a daughter to go with our son. The first we chose the inexpensive medication Femera and some blood test monitoring with ultrasounds and nothing happened, actually I ovulated earlier than what I was told to start monitoring so even though we made a last ditch effort, it was a failure.  The second month we did nothing special with drugs or treatment and I got pregnant immediately, and did not miscarry.  We did chromosome testing and the baby is healthy. Apparently the odds of conception and live birth aren't so impossible for everyone in my age group. I wish there was a better balance between statistics and an individuals personal factors based on diagnostic results where those that were as healthy as my own are taken into consideration.  Because all I heard sitting in that office and still ringing in my ears when I left the consultation with the doctor was that I might as well give up on ever having another child (unless I wanted to use donor eggs) but thankfully that was not my experience.  The only 'treatment' that they suggested that was different and may have made the difference and may have been the reason that I did not miscarry this time was that I was advised to start taking CoQ10 because it improves egg quality.  I do believe that with all of my other labs being better than the average that the one supplement was all it took to make the difference. \nIf there is anything I would say to someone in their 40's and hoping to have another child naturally is to be real about your own personal situation but do not let statistics discourage you and make you feel that no one has babies, or that if they do, that they aren't healthy babies when they are my age without the help of advanced fertility treatments because obviously that is only a statistic based on the known factor of the number of people in our age range who seek fertility assistance and not a solidly known fact. We don't really know how many people in their 40's attempt and succeed or fail at having a baby without medical assistance because of several factors. Many people finished having families in their 20's and 30's and consider their families complete and aren't trying to have more children and still many others who do want children choose not to seek assistance.", "time" 1520460253} {"author_name" "Nicole Merenivitch", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117581166181929332664/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Bw4LvpQt4xI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABLY/QewTulPcTSk/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "4 months ago", "text" "Dr Calhoun is an amazing doctor.

Tricare is still unaware I have used my referral.\n-The receptionist NEVER answers the phone after 10am. \n-They failed to follow HIPAA patient protocol! I requested a copy of my records the day of my follow up and they wouldn't give me one!

express just how grateful my wife and I are for Dr. Krause. We went to her in December 2016 after having a horrible experience at the UofL Fertility Clinic and she listened to our wants, figured out our needs, and worked with us as a team to help create our darling little ones. It took 5 IUIs and, finally, receipical ivf to make these two kids. Each time we failed, Dr. Krause was understanding and determined to try again. She made us feel confident and always took the time to explain everything in detail about procedures, next steps, and otions. As a lesbian couple of color, it was important that we found a care provider who could meet our specific needs. Moving into the receipical ivf process was a smooth and easy transition. We were successful on our first try that we did Aug 2017. In Feb, we welcomed two of the coolest kids. Without Krause, they simply wouldn't be here.

I read medical journal articles for fun (I'm weird, I know!) and Dr. Krause was never threatened by my knowledge or my suggestions.  I started at another office and they really pushed for IVF with donor eggs immediately after I became a patient there.  Dr. Krause was much more open-minded about allowing me to take my time and try some unconventional options before we went for donor eggs with IVF.  I am now 10 weeks pregnant and we conceived naturally thanks to the work I did with a local acupuncturist and the constant support and medical interventions Dr. Krause was willing to give me.  I adore Dr. Krause and all of the office staff.  I had one negative experience on my final visit with the practice (Dr. Krause was not working in the office that day) but I made my concerns known immediately and I imagine they won't make the same mistake again.

My daughter was experiencing severe stomach and back pain,  along with nausea and vomiting.  At first I thought it was food poisoning or dehydration, but when the symptoms got worse instead of better, I took her to the ER the next day.  What a joke.  The attending physician listened to her heart, prodded her stomach and ordered a urinalysis and gave her a pill for pain.  The tests came back fine and he basically said, and I quote \"It's not an emergency.  There's something wrong, but we don't know what's causing it. She's feeling better.\"  I said she's feeling better because you gave her a pain pill and anti-nausea medicine.  How about an X-ray or CT scan.  That was vetoed by the doctor.  We left $150 poorer and with her still in pain.  \n\nNext day, with symptoms worsening, I took her to Mercy Lorain.  They immediately hooked her up to an I.V. and administered fluids.  Took about six vials of blood and administered a CT scan.  Turns out the CT scan revealed she had a very bad kidney infection that if left untreated, could've had dire consequences.

Numerous times we have been sent to Cabell as direct admit and told we had a room ready on the pediatric floor and every time we are sent through the E.R. This last time was the worst and I refuse to ever take any of my children back. We were once again sent through the E.R. While our son was under respiratory distress had us sitting on a bed in the hallway for hours before ever putting us in an actual E.R room. Then once they finally moved us up to the pediatric floor the respiratory male nurse had 3 other female nurses to come in the room and hold my 16 month old son down just to put an oxygen lead in his nose. Then several nurses came in continuing to try and place an IV after I brought to their attention that my sons arm was swollen to the size of a golf ball because the original iv blew and none of the nurses bothered to Check it. They blew 5 of his veins and dug the needle around under his skin trying to find the vein, even popped his leg while \"holding\" him down. They had my baby so scared that he would go into fits anytime someone with gloves would walk into the room...horrible place.

We had gone through multiple blood test; two collected samples from my husband and hysteroscopy for me. The physicians assistant Janet is beautiful, and every time we saw her, she asked if Rochelle had called us yet to go over the pricing. After two months and of waiting for Rochelle to give us a call back after we had to reach on multiple occasions. \n\nShe finally called us back the day after my Hysteroscopy to tell us that we are $5,000 short, and we can't go any further without paying. Rochelle couldn't tell us where the money would go and the best answer that we got was, \"Well, it could be used for the second try if the first one doesn't work right.: Telling us that we needed extra money is something that should have been brought to our attention well before we even went through any heavy duty testing.  Throughout the entire phone call, she was horrible to have a conversation with even when I had to bring my husband in on the call Rochelle was condescending and downright nasty to him as well. She has the worst attitude of anyone who works there and to be honest, anyone who answered the phone at the Milburn Office is rude to speak with anyway. We should have been contacted by Rochelle when we started this process, not right before we were about to start the medication that I would have needed to take to get my hormones to the proper level and waste my once in lifetime use of my IVF Insurance deductible.  Before we started this process of trying to get pregnant again after a failed pregnancy, we had contacted the insurance company to make sure that other than co-pay's that there wouldn't be any extra money out of our pockets. Once they confirmed, my husband and I decided that we would go ahead with the procedures to get pregnant.\n\nRochelle said to me on the phone that If I wanted to get pregnant, I would figure out a way to get the money. It was hard not to be taken aback by that comment almost like she was holding a carrot over our heads. Wrong move lady, wrong move. \nWhen we had talked to Janet and told her that we weren't going to go further into the process because of Rochelle, she said that it hadn't been the first time she has turned people away from the practice. Dr. Yamin called me from Isreal while he was on vacation to talk me back into going through with the process, as his intentions were good he also couldn't tell me where the $5,000 was going to be applied too.  \n\nThis review has taken me some time to put together because I have needed to calm down and word it in a way that would give the reader a realistic view as to what they are going to get while going there.  The office staff in the Millburn office doesn't care about you, your struggles in your intimate life and all they want is your money. No please or thank you is used in that office. They have called me and asked me to leave them a review, and here it is and my sincere opinion.  Do not go there, go into the city or find someplace else. My husband and I are waiting to see another place to try again and hopefully get a better experience with this process that has been so hard from the get-go.\n\nMy advice to the company is to find new warmer people to work in your Millburn office. Hire people with compassion; work ethic as well as basic human emotions. We will not be back there, and we are disappointed that we waited our time energy and feelings on such a poorly ran facility.", "time" 1516577817} {"author_name" "Iceman Ram", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116374040243368173507/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kSwf0kwvo7A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXDi1ef1yfmi0CsQK6x9YZRgEt7dWA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "2 years ago", "text" "Absolutely Love the Diamond Institute\n\nDiamond has blessed us with 2 beautiful girls.

From the moment I contacted them, via their website, Sarah, the Practice Manager was very responsive, transparent, and extremely pleasant to deal with. She forwarded me to Janine, who is the Patient Liaison. We spoke on the phone, and it was as if she had known me my entire life. She made the conversation so easy, and effortless. She scheduled a visit with Dr. Levine for April 2017. We met with Michelle H., an RN in the office, and I was so pleasantly surprised by how extremely nice she was. I still, even after graduating, email her anytime I have questions, or want to share something. Even though she does not have to answer, she ALWAYS does, and I absolutely LOVE her! Dr. Levine is an incredible human being, and I am honored to have been able to have him on this journey with us. From day one, he smiled every single time he saw us. He took his time to explain everything to us from beginning to end, and answered all of our questions. He was enthusiastic, and full of energy every morning we went in for monitoring and insemination. I also have to thank Cathy, because every single time she took blood, I NEVER felt a thing. She is amazing at what she does, and always so nice to talk to.

I had a laparoscopy done and was supposed to follow up but when I call to do so they said Dr. Rostein was on vacation. Then when I went to the rescheduled appointment on the morning after work ( I work nigh shift) they told me Dr. had an emergency and could't see me. I understand emergency situations happen so I kept an open mind. I left and told them I would call to reschedule because I didn't have my work schedule with me. When I called,  Esmeralda the medical assistant gave me an attitude on the phone and claim why I haven't follow up after my laparoscopy. I got upset because it was their fault not mine. I had been trying to but either Dr. was on vacation or had emergency or not show up on my scheduled appointment. I told her this and she didn't say anything and reschedule without apologizing for her rude attitude. I decided to let that pass and continue because I had my hopes on Dr. Rostein, but then something else happened. I scheduled a blood draw for me and my husband who also had to get done a sperm analysis. I scheduled my appointment with this new medical assistant who was taking place of a pregnant medical assistant who is regularly there. I made sure and told her several times its an appointment for me and another for my husband. She assure me she scheduled  us both. My husband ask permission from work to come out from work  for his appointment and me after working a night shift met with him in the clinic. When I got there, Esmeralda called me in and they draw my blood and took me to the office and told me they wouldn't take my husband because he didn't have an appointment. I got really upset because I clearly told the new medical assistant about my husband and she clearly told me that she did set up an appointment for him. I explained this to Esmeralda and she was rude and insisted they wouldn't see him. It's not fair she wanted me to pay for the medical assistant's mistake. Going through infertility is hard and I understood right away that this place did not care for me at all. I cried and I guess she felt sorry for me and decided to see my husband. I decided not to come back because I didn't want to go further in the process in my infertility treatment with unprofessional unsympathetic staff. I just started IVF at RMI- Reproductive Medicine Institute with Dr.Rana at Oak Brook.

To some, it may seem overwhelming to be given a plan the first day, but to me it was everything I had hoped for. He went from diagnosing me with PCOS, to performing a laparoscopy to check the condition of my tubes, all in a matter of months. Dr. Rostein recommended that we go through the IUI process so that we don't jump the gun by going straight to his ultimate recommendation, IVF. After two failed IUIs, his suspicions were correct. In order for my husband and I to conceive, the only procedure that would work would be IVF. Throughout the whole process, it felt like I was his only patient. So much attention was given to every detail to my case, that it seemed like no other patient mattered, even though I would see his office full of patients. His entire team is just amazing!

We ended up with 3 viable embryos and he got us pregnant with all 3 attempts. He is smart, compassionate and accommodating. When our surrogate requested to have the final embryo shipped to a clinic closer to her, he gave valuable advice, and it was clear that he was more interested in our success than our business. That's a rarity these days. \n\nOur problems were - everything else. But mostly lack of clarity, from the simple to the very important. Pricing wasn't clear. They quoted us the price of IVF, but IVF cost was 1/3 of our grand total. We are a gay couple, and all of the patient forms say \"Female Patient/Male Partner\" and we were told they could not be changed. There is a Risk Factor form, where they ask if I am a man who has had sex with men, and because I said yes, my surrogate had to sign a form saying she was accepting \"known/suspected infectious materials\" into her body. My blood tests were clear; this was ONLY because I'm gay. The room where I gave my sperm samples was oddly placed, not sound proof, the internet channels we're mostly not functioning, and there were only materials for straight men. Dr Lanski, the psychologist made our surrogate and egg donor uncomfortable. They felt that, rather than breaking down the harsh realities of the process, she was aiming to put doubt in their heads. The egg donor felt this, and she is also a psychologist. She told our surrogate that if she were not a \"known surrogate\" she would have \"failed\" because she used depression meds to readjust to work after her son was born. Also, there was miscommunication about how many viable embryos were frozen - a voice mail made it seem like we froze 4, when in reality only 2 were frozen. \n\nWe had a miscarriage with our second pregnancy and the nurses failed to inform us of the doctor's assessment of the ultrasound. Instead, they told us to remain hopeful because the fetus had grown a little and there was slight cardiac activity visible. We were measuring 2 weeks behind, and the heart was not strong enough to listen to at 8 weeks. Dr Rapisarda knew it was over, but that's not what the nurses communicated to us. Then one nurse offered to have a test kit sent for the D&C to see what caused the miscarriage. She failed to send the kit and blamed me for not communicating properly. I became frustrated with her, but did not swear at or insult her. I asked, \"Did you think that I stopped wanting to know why my baby died?\" She told me that she would no longer take my verbal abuse, and would no longer work with me - the week our baby died. She then assigned a different nurse to work with us. In all fairness, I believe this horrible nurse is no longer with FCI. But this was how our miscarriage was handled. This wasn't the only time I sensed frustration from the staff. \n\nA lot of frustrating things happened, but I would still recommend FCI. Dr Rapisarda knows what he's doing, and when it boils down to it, that's the ONLY thing that matters. We have a beautiful 3 year old girl, and another girl due by Thanksgiving. Our life is forever changed for the better because of FCI. I feel like if I would have known all of the frustrating possibilities going into it, they would have been less frustrating. So, hopefully someone reads this and thinks, \"Ok, nurses are not always great, forms are poorly made, and pricing will probably be unclear. Got it. Now let's make a baby with one of the best doctors around!\"", "time" 1505405106} {"author_name" "Lauren Vourvoulias", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111830798660825184132/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MwcEdeojjQo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXA060LQpUOZMj-KAxCNKUlhw7edJA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "8 months ago", "text" "My husband and I have been TTC for three years; I have PCOS and other underlying issues that caused problems with conceiving without some help. We were referred to FCI by my OB and I picked Dr. Rapisarda, who I really love. I know that this location has a few doctor's so I cannot speak for others, but I know he is fantastic. My husband and I have been having IUI procedures, on our second try we got pregnant, however due to a chromosome abnormality (completely a fluke), I lost the baby at almost 9 weeks. Dr. Rapisarda and his team of nurses were excellent! I figured we were going to get the push to IVF talk, but he was compassionate and completely on board with what we wanted. He even recommended not just jumping right to IVF as this was always an option if for some reason the IUIs didn't work moving forward. He lets us make the decisions but is a guiding hand to make sure that everything will go smoothly. His nurses are honestly the best team of nurses I have had the privilege of working with; all are very responsive to questions. I will say that the billing for FCI locations, in general, is a bit crazy if you are self pay like we are.

They don’t have someone to answer the phone so you can not get in contact with them directly but have to leave a message and wait for them to get back to you.  Normally this is fine but not always.  A couple of my experiences below.\n\nFor example- my OB here in South Bend calls me during the day and says they won’t be able to do the required ultrasound because the orders did not specify that date (the one determining if my eggs are the right size to be harvested).  So I call and leave a message.  Hours later I still have not gotten a return call, so I call back a few more times, and now the office is closed to answering messages.  Call the ob again and “sorry we can’t” is still the answer.  After 5 when I don’t know what to do I finally get a call from the ob that the nurse had read the doctor’s instructions wrong and would be able to do it anyway.  So turned out ok in the end but not because this office helped the situation.\n\nExample two.  I drive down to the office (2.5 hours away) on a warm winter day in Indy but snowing freezing day in South Bend).  I walk out without my two sons’ coats but didn’t discover it until 2ish.  Call and leave a message.  An hour later do the same.  (We we’re tied up doing some other things in Indy).  At 3:30 call any number I can relating to the office and finally get the financial lady.  Turns out they will still be open by the time I can make it there (barely) and the coats are there.  Super frustrating experience that would have been so much better if I could just talk to a receptionist.\n\nExample 3.  I have undergone laparoscopy and hysteroscopy here in SB because my ob is in network.  Need to fax the records and talk to Dr provost about what is next.  Monday call and leave message that I need to talk to Dr provost and my dr will be faxing records.  Get a message back that day that they didn’t Have the fax but they willl call me when they do.  (I expected it to go through because I asked my ob 3 times to send the records and they said they would.  Wednesday I call and I’m my ob and they said they did on Monday.  Leave a message with this offi e that they should have the fax and I checked that everyone has the right numbers.  Call back that they did get the fax on Monday and I needed to schedule a phone consult.  So they transferred me “to the front desk” where I am again left with an answering machine.  So I say what happened and I need to schedule a phone consult.  Nothing.  I guess I will be calling and leaving another message on Monday to do so,  this has taken More than a week to confirm a fax and schedule an appointment!\n\nThis is already an emotionally charged experience with infertility and it all relies on timing and ultrasounds and scheduling and not being able to get a hold of them during office hours when things go off plan is extremely frustrating.  It is also expensive like all infertility is it would be nice to have people working with you better.\n\nThere was also one receptionist who was very rude to me when I was trying to pay my bill and understand what prices were from what.  My situation is not the normal because I come from south bend and so have a different package than most but I was trying to understand what visits were covered in the package and what I should get done in South Bend.  So I understand confusion and not knowing the answer but it wasn’t fun to be gotten frustrated and huffy at when I was was trying to figure it out especially since I hadn’t refused to pay or anything like that.", "time" 1526861972} {"author_name" "Marisol Cruz", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102693600985931070074/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-19iKE3SW--g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AIcfdXA6tg0iB7YW7qF6HX692dIwysP-xQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating" 1, "relative_time_description" "a week ago", "text" "This place never calls you back and I never got my new patient package in the mail.

Totally unacceptable! 1st  2 nurses I had were great. The 2nd day nurse totally screwed up my medication scheduling causing more pain which in turn made me stand up till I got out of the hospita because it was to painful to lay in bed or sit. She gave me meds then posted that she had given them an hour later then she actually had.\nSo rather then just having 9 out 10 pain I was having withdraw symptoms.  \nI use to recommend this hospital to eveyone. Never again. It's now on the bottom of my list. Can't wait to find the name of the recovery nurse. Her and her supervisor are going to make changes or I'll keep moving my way up management till I get an adiquit response. Reprimand,  training, fired, I don't care.

Union memorial nurses, and I generalize because there have been those few exceptional nurses, clearly do not want to work very hard and some are downright lazy.  The cna staff worse!

I truly believe if it wasn't for Dr. Hinton my wife would have never found out why she was having a problem getting pregnant.  My wife had a miscarriage last year, and she was not getting the attention that she needed from her GYN.  A GYN that had been in her family for a long time.  She finally decided to make a change, and Dr. Hinton was the best thing that could of ever happened to her.  Dr.  Hinton knew all the right questions to ask, and right tests for my wife to take.  Dr. Hinton diagnosed that her issue was her fallopian tubes, and that because of a bacterial infection that occured over a decade ago that never cleared up that she would never be able to have a baby naturally.  This was pretty demoralizing news, but Dr. Hinton was open and transparent, and figured it out so quickly.  This is really all we could of ever asked for from a doctor.  Dr. Hinton then gave us guidance on what our next options are to have a child.  She explained IVF thoroughly, and she really knew her stuff.  We wanted to check out a place that is known for IVF called Shady Grove before we determined on who to help with the IVF process.  After visiting Shady Grove in Annapolis we knew they were not the place to help us have a child.  They treated us like another number, and we're trying to sell us on going with them.  We would of never received the individual attention my wife desperately needed.  Dr. Hinton was our choice and she has not disappointed.  Her office manager Julie has been stellar as well.  They both have been on top of it from the beginning of our journey.  Very quick to respond to email and text messages.  They both have a wealth of experience, and knowledge when it comes to women's fertility.  Dr. Hinton had easy to follow IVF instructions.  My wife took some shots for about a week, and then had 10 eggs taken out of her.  3 eggs made it to day 5 blastocyst.  We implanted 2 eggs ( because of my wife's age she is 36) and froze one.  A week later we are happy to announce that my wife is pregnant.  Dr. Hinton is truly a blessing, she uncovered my wife's problem, and helped her get pregnant all in about three months.

All communications went smoothly, my voicemails were returned, prescriptions called to the Pharmacy near me, appointment kept as booked. Dr Padilla patiently answered my complicated questions and explained to me why his protocol is different than those I knew before in my 2 yrs of attempts for artificial insemination. He is an endocrinologist who discovered quickly through labs where my chemical gaps are. I'm hopeful because he addressed my options and didn't push me into another IVF that I can't afford. I felt relaxed and cared for, not just a statistic. Nurses were very receptive to my (I admit) quite picky questions.

Unfortunately, there needs to be some changes with staff and general attitude of some people who work there. I have been a patient at this clinic since 2012. When I started using them I worked specifically with Sarah. She was FANTASTIC. She was always kind, friendly and never treated me as if I were interrupting her from something more important. We had successful fresh cycle the first try and were left with embryos remaining to be frozen. We started the FET process in 2015. This time around was very different from our first. My general complaint with this clinic is with the way some of the staff treats patients. I was in this office more than 10-15 times. Only once do I remember a pleasant encounter at the front desk.  I was treated as though I was interrupting social hour or personal phone calls. I was over charged, I was the one who caught the mistake and was treated as though I had caused it. It took several calls, messages and finally a trip in person to correct.  Debby was my IVF coordinator for all 4 FET cycles. While I think she is nice person, I always felt as if I was interrupting her or as if I had done something wrong. Every time I spoke with her I felt as if I were a child waiting to be scolded. I don't know how long she has worked as an IVF coordinator, but it feels like she's been at it for awhile and she seems to be over it or ready to retire. I have no complaints with Dr Moutos or Dr Batres aside from the fact that they seem extremely busy. I love Lauren, Patsy, Myra and Mahlon. I had several exchanges with each of these people. They were always kind, thoughtful and genuine. There were several other nurses who I had interactions with and while I don't recall their names, they were very kind as well. My rating of 3 stars is for the staff who work in this clinic beyond the front office. They were very good and deserve to be recognized. My opinion is that there needs to be new front office management put in place. There needs to be a better system in place for speaking with a nurse or having general questions answered. Too many times I left a non urgent message that was never returned.  I believe the people who are greeting and interacting with patients should be reminded often that without these patients they may not have a job or paycheck. I truly hope that someone in this office reads these reviews.

She was in ICU the next day and they said she was going to a room as soon as they had one available. We left and at 3 in the morning we got a call saying I needed to hurry back up there. When I got there they said in the ICU unit that she had threw up in her respirator and it had gone down in her lungs. They had tied her hands up where she couldn’t get it off. Why they did that they we weren’t told. We could see that she had been with out oxygen and had brain damage. She could no longer talk or respond to us. They had the nerve then to say that she was going to die anyway. After I got through telling them what I thought they got in a huddle and started talking about us. Here we were by her bed side and people started walking back looking at us. I said something to the young doctor about it and he said , well we talk about everybody. Told him to get his ass up and leave. I knew then that she was going to die for no reason. They acted like they needed her out of that room. Had some girl there we called the lady of death. Kept coming in the room saying that she was going to die anyway. We left before I was hauled off to jail. Never in my life had I seen anything like it. She died about 3 that morning before I could get to her. Just 4 days earlier she was ok. I give it 2 stars because everyone else in the hospital had done a great job and was nice as could be. What ever you or anybody else does I beg you please if you’re loved one has to go to the ICU unit get them out of there as fast as you can. Heard they were in bad financial trouble and wondered if they just wanted the bed space. You need more info please text me. I was there for over a year.", "time" 1519245532} {"author_name" "Yas Yas", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113757755772505088319/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url"

She doesn't take the time to let you know what's going on, what to expect moving forward, or to really talk with you at all. One failed attempt at pregnancy after the next, and she never once said anything encouraging to me, or offered any support emotionally about what I was going through. When in dyer need of clarification after a million Nurses told me a million different things, I asked for the Doctor to call me, and was promptly informed that \"the Doctor doesn't call patients... that's what the Nurses are for.\" That's a problem... there is just no ACTUAL care taken by this Doctor at all.\nThere is no financial guideline given to patients so that you know what to expect. They collect your money and tell you that'll be all for the month, and then out of nowhere they say there's another random test needed. They will refuse to move forward with what you have already paid for if you don't give them more money for more testing. Shouldn't this be organized? This IS what they do day in and day out, right? \nIt is just very obvious that this practice isn't in it for their patients, and for helping families grow.

You will continue to receive charges and bills from this clinic LONG after you terminate treatment. A single office visit will usually result in a bill from the lab, the fertility clinic, and sometimes the hospital.. \n\nI won't speak negatively about the doctors or the staff. They all try very hard. The receptionist is amazing and will remember your name months afterward when you have to go in to ask the business office what they're still billing you for. \n\nHowever, at the end of the day you need to remember that this is an elective clinic and they are selling you services. I'm not suggesting that they intentionally sell you unnecessary services. I'm saying that if things don't turn out well and they see an outstanding balance accruing on your account they will send in a doctor that you've never met to coldly tell you that you should \"take some time\" before starting again. (Not a coincidence, we've been through it several times) They require immediate payment for services (no payment plans) and they will start sending things to collections before they are even able to tell you how much you owe them or even what some of the charges are for.\n\nFour months after my wife stopped treatment we were still receiving new billing charges from them. I talked to the business office and was given what I assumed would be the final amount since we hadn't been there in months. A couple of weeks later when I tried to pay that amount, the total had increased by 30%!!!! And three business office people standing around a computer for ten minutes STILL couldn't tell me why it had increased.\n\nIf you're reading this and seeking fertility treatment in the area, you don't really have many other choices. Hopefully things go well for you. There are some very good people at the clinic who will try very hard to help you. It's unfortunate that this clinic is run by an extremely incompetent business office who wants their money immediately, even if they're completely unable to tell you what they're even demanding money

My GI saw me & admitted me on the first appt. I was in Froedtert five days, and ended up having to be readmitted when I had a recurrence about six weeks later.\n\nThe GI doctors were excellent. I did have an incident with one nurse on the first stay. I told her my IV hurt and my arm was swelling. She taped it tighter. When it became unbearable and I insisted it was huge, she finally looked at it, yelled “Dear God” and stopped the IV. I was receiving bicarbonate fluid, not just saline. She did the opposite of what was supposed to be done according to the IV team, and by then it was too late. They had to mark the swollen area and put pictures in my file and told me that it may cause lasting damage to the vein and/or tissue. The other nurses, and especially the nurses on the second stay, were wonderful, as was the hospital doctor, Dr. Cobb. She was very kind and an excellent doctor.\n\nBilling is a disaster. I see by other comments I am not alone.  I received very inconsistent answers. I was left with a large balance after insurance because of all the treatment. The first rep told me if I had more than $5000 I didn’t qualify for any assistance. I found out later from other reps that was not true, and two encouraged me to file for some assistance because of what I owed. \n\nI was waiting on that paperwork and that same first rep called the day before Thanksgiving, again telling me the  incorrect information regarding the $5000 threshold, and demanding that I set up a payment plan. I was so frustrated I called back and asked for a supervisor who verified the $5000 was not correct and that any assistance is determined by a different department. She told me she was going to pull that phone call and listen to what I was told so she could address it. She also sent me the assistance forms because they were not sent, and all of this of course caused a big delay.\n\nI finally got the forms, and within a week got another bill and another phone call, and that rep told me I could be sent to collections. I don’t think you can send an account to collections if the person is appealing and asking for a review of the account, especially when the process was delayed because the first representative gave incorrect information.\n\nI  sent in the forms as quickly as I could, but being told it could go to collections I called and asked for the supervisor I had previously spoken with. She was not available so I had a different supervisor. She called the office that reviews these applications and said it wasn’t even entered into their spreadsheet, and said she would call me back. She never did. I waited a day and called her back because I didn’t want this in collections. Her attitude had changed and she sounded irritated and told me she hoped I had made copies of everything and that she was planning on calling me back after checking on it again, but that this other office didn’t have it. She told me to email everything, which is crazy and asking for identity theft, sending all of your personal information to another office, and not even given a name of someone to send it to. This supervisor again said she would follow up, but again didn’t.\n\nI finally gave up realizing I was not going to get anywhere, called and asked about a payment plan. The rep offered four months, which would be astronomical, and I told him I thought it was 12 months. \n\nI am adding an edit as this nightmare continues. This month alone I got three bills with different amounts. They added another $1500 to the total with no explanation, charged my cc for a thousand more than they should have, and an hour and a half with a supervisor brought 9 totals, all wrong.

(The first two where short term.)  All three were amazing but at this point my anxiety was so bad I wasn't leaving the house.  My doctor at the time who was a physician's assistant randomly started taking me off blood pressure medications and refused to refill my xanax.  Getting kind of sketched out I followed a friend's advice and changed over to Family Practice.  There I was only able to get yet another physician's assistant who told me she did not feel comfortable prescribing me anything for anxiety besides the very small dosage of antidepressants that I was already taking.  Now keep in mind after all that had gone on my family was very concerned about me and my dad came to my appointment.  The physician's assistant then had somebody from Behavioral Health come in and told me that \"we were going to fix my panic attacks in 20 minutes\" and that they wouldn't be prescribing me any more Xanax.  At this point I was furious but my dad and I went along with it anyway.  Needless to say after 20 minutes of this woman telling me that I'm not running away from lions and tigers and shouldn't be having panic attacks my anxiety did not go away. She didn't ask me anything about my friend's death even though I did try to bring it up.  Fast forward about a month later I'm laying in bed thinking of what the strongest place to hang myself from would be.  Ultimately I decided that my dad didn't need to see his only son hanging in a stairwell and I rode it out.  I don't know how to explain what it feels like to have that much anxiety but it's painful.  The next day I went on MyCare from work and wrote an email begging for help as a last resort.  I asked for anything that would help with anxiety as I didn't want to appear like a drug seeker and who knows maybe there's other medications that would help.  The nurses who answered told me the doctor is not willing to prescribe me anything and if I'm feeling this way I should check myself into inpatient Behavioral Health.  At this point I was way out of time off at work as my Grandpa had also passed away around the same time and because of my anxiety I had been calling him too much as it is.  I didn't want to check myself into inpatient because I had been there before to visit a friend and I didn't think it was a good place to be.  So here we are a little over a year later.  I've been fired from my job and I now have no health insurance.  I'm doing a lot better but still have a hard time leaving the house sometimes.  I really am not expecting anything from Gundersen at all at this point and I'm relying on friends and family for a lot of support.  Please if you or a loved one have any type of depression or anxiety do not rely on Gundersen Health System.  This may involve driving out of town but it'll be well worth it.", "time" 1522995051} {"author_name" "Nancy Stevens", "author_url" "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113696367322040898496/reviews", "language" "en", "profile_photo_url" "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OzgROgSc16A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADI/PO0T2G5Y_P0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating" 5, "relative_time_description" "3 months ago", "text" "Always makes you feel comfortable.

My husband and I were thoroughly tested to try uncover the underlying fertility issues.   After that part was completed and treatment began I never saw my doctor,  Dr. Jaffe, and my treatment appeared routine and like a blanket treatment for everyone.   I was never checked in on after a failed iui and consulted with for the next plan of action or an aggressive next step but was just ordered to do the same thing the first time around.   We paid for something in full once when the insurance covered it completely and then was given a hard time to get reimbursed.   I finally decided to switch doctors and requested my records.   Come to find out after reading my records my doctor has indicated things in my file that we did as treatment that we NEVER did.  So she's obviously got too many patients that she is confusing them or not keeping up with proper notes.  What topped everything off was that about a month after requesting my records I get a bill in the mail now for somethimg else entirely different that again wasn't done with me during my treatment with them.   In trying to get a hold of someone in billing was another headache because no one ever answered my phone call or returned my call.
